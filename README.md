#Calculate IT!

A small calculator project to practice logical thinking and use javascript.
The project was a small challenge for me, when introducing the function buttons I had to plan the logic of the calculator and then write it in such a way that the code was quite clean and readable.
A small, quick project that definitely taught me a lot.
